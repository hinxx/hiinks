= Introduction =

pyTv is intended to be used on set-top box, such as Asrock ION330.

I'm currently using XBMC for my media player and I'm not really satisfied how it performs. Also, I would like to have the control on small code base 
where I can add / remove features as needed.

= Details =

What I need:
 * Video format playback
 * Live TV (UDP stream) playback
 * Music format playback
 * Photobook
 * IR Remote controlled
 * Minimal and ergonomic UI
 * Other

What I would also like:
 * IMDB support
 * EPG support
 * playlists
 * etc..

= Software =

I intend on using python and all sorts of useful modules such as:
 * libVLC 1.1 python bindings - http://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings
 * pyQt4 - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
 * pyLirc - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylirc/
